bio: Professor Soraya Murray is an interdisciplinary scholar of contemporary visual culture, with particular interest in contemporary art, cultural studies and video games. Murray holds a Ph.D. in art history and visual studies from Cornell University, and an MFA in Studio Art from the University of California, Irvine. An Assistant Professor in the Film + Digital Media Department at the University of California, Santa Cruz, she is also principal faculty in the Digital Arts + New Media MFA Program, and the Art + Design: Games + Playable Media Program. Murray’s book, On Video Games: The Visual Politics of Race, Gender and Space (I.B. Tauris, 2018), considers video games from a visual culture perspective, and how they both mirror and are constitutive of larger societal fears, dreams, hopes and even complex struggles for recognition.
