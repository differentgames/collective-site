bio: Christina “Phazero” Curlee is a game designer and game artist based in Los Angeles, California. A first year MFA student at the University of California, she enjoys creating boundary breaking games that explore emotional experiences, marginalized identities, “digital consciousness”, and video games as art practice. Her current project is a game experience about childhood neglect, techno-paganism, and what it means to be an adult that has learned to live comfortably with trauma in the digital era.
