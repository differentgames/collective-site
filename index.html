    </p>
    <p>
      Different Games Collective is a grassroots volunteer-run collaborative of a half-dozen core members, as well as an extended network of contributing members and a host of volunteer supporters. Known as the creators of <strong>the annual Brooklyn-based Different Games Conference</strong>, the collective has broadened our reach to include public programming in other US cities including smaller-scale game design workshops, lectures and more.

    <h2>Inclusivity Statement</h2>
    <h3>Online Resources</h3>
    <p>
      For four years, the Different Games Conference has addressed the need for creating safer spaces for games community members to share about our work and experiences. Our Inclusivity Statement, a living document we use to foster dialogue and facilitate accountability at our events, has been used as a template by a growing number of organizations interested in implementing safer space policies.

    <p>
      We are pleased to announce that <strong>the fourth annual Different Games Conference</strong> took place on <strong>April 8-9, 2016 at NYU MAGNET in Brooklyn, NY</strong>!
    </p>

    <p>
      Each year, Different Games works to foster diversity and inclusivity in games by amplifying the creative and critical voices of marginalized participants in games culture. Geared towards accessibility and radical inclusivity, our annual volunteer-led conference welcomes panels, workshops and playable games from presenters of all professional backgrounds and levels of expertise. Our programming is diverse and interdisciplinary with a focus on featuring emerging voices and representing identities and perspectives not typically supported by the commercial industry.
