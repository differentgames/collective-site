    <h2>Inclusivity Statement</h2>
    <h3>Online Resources</h3>
    <p>
      For four years, the Different Games Conference has addressed the need for creating safer spaces for games community members to share about our work and experiences. Our Inclusivity Statement, a living document we use to foster dialogue and facilitate accountability at our events, has been used as a template by a growing number of organizations interested in implementing safer space policies.
